# Particle_Filter_SLAM
Robotics systems perceive their environments through sensors and manipulate their environment through things that move. In designing these systems, one must consider the different kinds of uncertainties such as dynamic and unpredictable environments, noisy sensors, inaccurate actuators and motors, imperfect computational models and many such nondeterministic factors. As robots move more towards autonomy space, there would be more emphasis on real time software systems, and thus this makes SLAM a critical problem in robotics. 

This project was aimed at implementing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using odometry, 2-D LiDAR scans and stereo camera measurements from an autonomous car. The IMU and Encoder data of the autonomous car were used to estimate the next state of the robot using a differential-drive motion model. Using particle filters, the localization of the ego car was predicted and updated. An occupancy grid map was generated, and robotâ€™s position updated using lidar readings and scan-grid correlation observation model.
